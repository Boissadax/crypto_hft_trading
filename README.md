# Clean Async Crypto HFT Trading System

## Overview

This project implements a production-ready high-frequency cryptocurrency trading system focused on asynchronous event-driven order book processing. After comprehensive codebase cleanup, it now contains only the essential components for detecting lead-lag relationships between crypto pairs using correlation-based analysis, with realistic transaction cost modeling.

## 🎯 Professor Requirements Compliance

✅ **No synchronization into uniform time bins** - Events processed in original chronological order  
✅ **Direct asynchronous timestamp processing** - Preserves exact microsecond timing  
✅ **Cross-crypto lead-lag signal extraction** - Correlation-based detection on raw events  
✅ **Proper in-sample/out-of-sample splits** - Temporal separation for robust validation  
✅ **Realistic transaction costs** - Includes maker/taker fees, slippage, and commissions  
✅ **Net alpha reporting** - Performance calculated after all costs  
✅ **Sub-second HFT data handling** - Optimized for high-frequency processing

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Event Stream Creation
- Order book snapshots → chronological events
- Price, spread, volume changes detected
- Exact timing preserved (no interpolation)

### 2. Lead-Lag Detection
- Event-driven correlation analysis
- Price movement propagation tracking
- Confidence scoring based on timing/magnitude

### 3. Signal Generation
- Real-time pattern recognition
- Multi-feature analysis (price, spread, volume)
- Lag timing in microseconds

### 4. Trading Strategy
- Signal threshold filtering
- Position sizing based on confidence
- Market order execution simulation

### 5. Transaction Cost Modeling
```python
# Realistic cost structure
costs = TransactionCosts(
    maker_fee=0.0001,      # 1 bp maker
    taker_fee=0.0002,      # 2 bp taker  
    slippage_bps=0.5,      # 0.5 bp slippage
    min_commission=0.01    # $0.01 minimum
)
```

### 6. Temporal Validation
- 70% in-sample period (pattern detection)
- 15% validation period (parameter optimization)  
- 15% out-of-sample period (final testing)

## 🎓 Academic Context

This implementation addresses common issues in HFT research:

1. **Temporal Synchronization Bias**: Most academic studies synchronize asynchronous data to uniform time grids, losing crucial timing information for lead-lag analysis.

2. **Transaction Cost Underestimation**: Many papers ignore realistic market impact, slippage, and fee structures.

3. **Look-Ahead Bias**: Improper temporal splits can leak future information into historical analysis.

4. **Microstructure Artifacts**: Linear interpolation creates artificial price movements that don't reflect true market dynamics.

This system preserves the authentic characteristics of high-frequency market data while providing a robust framework for academic research.
